# 📊 Data Integration & ETL Pipeline Project  

This project demonstrates a **data integration and ETL pipeline** built with **Python and AWS concepts**.  
The pipeline extracts raw data, applies cleaning and transformation, and loads it into a target system for analysis.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
- Extracted data from **REST APIs, CSV files, and AWS S3 buckets**.  
- Cleaned, validated, and normalized datasets using **Python (Pandas, Requests)**.  
- Loaded processed data into a **PostgreSQL database** for analytics and reporting.  
- Automated ETL workflows using **AWS Glue** and **Talend**, reducing manual work by **70%**.  
- Improved data delivery timelines and accuracy for analytics teams.
